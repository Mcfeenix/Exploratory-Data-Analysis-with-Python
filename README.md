# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python
### Description
This project continues where the [Data-Cleaning-with-Python](https://github.com/Mcfeenix/Data-Cleaning-with-Python.git) project left off. Several features/columns from the Global Countries Information dataset are selected for further analysis. These features are:
- CO2 Emissions
- Population
- Gross Domestic Product

The original dataset contains information on 195 countries and originates from the *Global Country Information Dataset 2023* by Nidula Elgiriyewithana. Access to the original dataset is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/countries-of-the-world-2023/data).

The project starts with addressing missing values in key columns, proceeds to analyze their descriptive statistics and distributions, and then examines inter-variable relationships using visualizations, log transformations, correlation metrics, and outlier identification.

The final visualization is an interactive Plotly scatterplot, included in this repository as *plotly_scatter.html*. Users can explore the data by hovering over points to reveal country names. A static image of the plot is below.
